# YelpCamp

The YelpCamp application is the gigantic application based in the The Web Developer Bootcamp course given by Colt Steele
which is offered in Udemy.com
I learnt a lot from this app since Colt is teaching everything step by step including:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4, SemanticUI, DOM Manipulation, jQuery, Unix(Command Line) Commands, NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS, REST,
MongoDB, Database Associations, Authentication, PassportJS, Authorization.

After finishing this course I feel myself comfortable enough to build a web application from scrath using all the tools stated 
above without refering to their definitions even though I had to do it in the very beginning.


[by the way... I am still doing it :) ]

Thank You Colt for such the beautiful Application !!!
You are the best!!
